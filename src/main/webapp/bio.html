    <p>Eleanor Briccetti's passion for nature photography stems from a love of wildlife, the outdoors, and
    birdwatching. Some of her favorite haunts include the San Francisco Bay shoreline, Palo Alto Baylands
    Preserve, Sacramento and Klamath National Wildlife Refuges, The Grand Tetons, the Palouse area of
    Southeast Washington, and Yellowstone National Park.</p>
    
    <p>The San Francisco Bay Area became home in 1994, following a move from Indianapolis, where Eleanor
    enjoyed a busy career as a professional violinist. She was a member of the orchestras of Kansas
    City, Indianapolis, and St. Louis, was an active chamber music performer, ran a program for young
    violinists and cellists, and taught violin privately. Her interest in photography began as a young
    girl, undoubtedly influenced by her father, an avid amateur photographer.</p>

    <p>Eleanor's works have been displayed at the Holiday Park Nature Center in Indianapolis, The University
    of Indianapolis, Portland State University, Sea Ranch Lodge and Gualala Arts Center on the Northern
    California coast, and several Bay Area locations, such as Albany Arts Gallery, Berkeley Store Gallery,
    Los Medanos College, Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge, and Hayward Shoreline
    Interpretive Center. She is a member of Bay Area Bird Photographers and Image Circle Photographers.
    Publications include <i>Birder's World, Wildlife Refuge Magazine, American Bird Conservancy Magazine,
    Wildbird, Grit Magazine, Eldr Magazine, Outdoor California Magazine, Bay Nature, Sierra Club
    Yodeler Magazine, Family News, Children's Community Center 1999 and 2000 Yearbooks, and the
    University of Indianapolis Alumni Magazine</i>. In 2001 she was a Merit Award Winner in <i>National
    Wildlife's</i> 31st annual photography competition, received an Honorable Mention in the
    2003 <i>Birder's World</i> photo contest, and won 2nd place in the international category of <i>Wildbird's</i>
    2005 photo contest.</p>
